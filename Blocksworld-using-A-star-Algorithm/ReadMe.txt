Instructions for compiling and running the main.cpp file :

The code is in C++ under the file name main.cpp

Build and run the cpp file and then follow the instructions on the command line. 

Command prompt will ask to enter number of blocks and number of stacks. Enter with a space. 
e.g.
	
	Enter number of Blocks and Stacks respectively
	5 3

After this, the program will print the statistics related to that particular goal search. 

P.S. In case you want to run the program for specific initial states that definitely lead to goal states (though those screenshots 
have already been added in the report), inside the main function several examples have been created and commented out. You can 
comment the "problemGenerator" function and remove comments from one of the examples and run the program. Don't forget to mention 
the number of blocks and number of stacks here, that data is being used further in the code. Thanks!
