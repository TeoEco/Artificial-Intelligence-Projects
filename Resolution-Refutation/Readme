Instructions for compiling and running the main.cpp file :

The code is in C++ under the file name main.cpp 

There are two files included:
1. example1KB.txt
	This file has the example1.kb given in the assignment.
2. example.txt
	This file contains the knowledge base for Sammy's sport shop.

By default the main.cpp file uses the knowledge base for Sammy's sport shop i.e. example.txt but you 
can change the input by editing inside the code and replacing the filename as example1KB.txt on line #385.

* You can give any knowledge base file name on line #385 and then compile and run the code.

Build and run the cpp file and wait for the result to pull up on the screen. 

The screen will display the number of iterations, maximum queue size and the proof tree showing the sequence 
of resolutions is resolved successfully else a failure message.

* If you want you can give different inputs to sammy's sports shop file i.e. example.txt
* You can change the last line of the example.txt file to any input and see if that's a valid input or not.

** Knowledge base file also included as KB.txt
